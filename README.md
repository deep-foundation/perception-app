# How to make this repository pullable in your repository
```
git remote add sdk https://github.com/deep-foundation/sdk.git
git fetch sdk
git merge sdk/main --allow-unrelated-histories --strategy ours 
```
Note that we use `ours` strategy during merge to avoid any changed in your existing project
## How to pull some new commits but not old
If you want to get some-commits to your repository - merge with `ours` strategy with old sdk commit that is created before required changes and then merge with main
```
git remote add sdk https://github.com/deep-foundation/sdk.git
git fetch sdk
git merge sdk/some_old_commit_hash --allow-unrelated-histories --strategy ours
git merge sdk/main
```

Now you can pull changes from this repository by using
```
git pull sdk main
```
